    print("""
    Gravitational Potential Energy is the energy an object has because
    of its POSITION (height) above the ground.

    Key Points:
    -----------
    ‚Ä¢ The higher something is ‚Üí More potential energy
    ‚Ä¢ The heavier something is ‚Üí More potential energy
    ‚Ä¢ If something is at ground level (h=0) ‚Üí Zero potential energy

    Formula: PE = mgh
    --------
    Notice that height is NOT squared (unlike kinetic energy!)
    - Double the height ‚Üí Double the potential energy
    - Double the mass ‚Üí Double the potential energy

    Real-World Examples:
    -------------------
    1. Water at top of waterfall:
       - Has high PE
       - Falls down ‚Üí PE converts to KE (kinetic energy)
       - Hits bottom ‚Üí KE converts to sound, heat, splash

    2. Roller coaster at the top:
       - Maximum PE
       - Rolls down ‚Üí PE ‚Üí KE
       - Goes fast at bottom (maximum KE, minimum PE)

    3. Book on a shelf:
       - Has PE because it's above ground
       - Falls ‚Üí PE converts to KE
       - Hits floor ‚Üí Makes sound (energy transfer)

    Units:
    ------
    ‚Ä¢ Potential Energy: Joules (J)
    ‚Ä¢ Mass: kilograms (kg)
    ‚Ä¢ Gravity: meters per second squared (m/s¬≤)
    ‚Ä¢ Height: meters (m)

    SI Unit of Energy = Joule (J) = kg‚ãÖm¬≤/s¬≤

    Important Constant:
    ------------------
    g = 9.81 m/s¬≤ (on Earth)
    g = 10 m/s¬≤ (often used in exams for simplicity)

    On other planets, g is different:
    - Moon: g ‚âà 1.6 m/s¬≤
    - Mars: g ‚âà 3.7 m/s¬≤
    - Jupiter: g ‚âà 24.8 m/s¬≤

    Remember Question 3? We calculated Kinetic Energy!
    Now let's compare both types of energy:

    POTENTIAL ENERGY (PE)      |  KINETIC ENERGY (KE)
    ===========================|==========================
    Energy due to POSITION     |  Energy due to MOTION
    (height above ground)      |  (speed of object)
                               |
    Formula: PE = mgh          |  Formula: KE = ¬Ωmv¬≤
                               |
    Depends on HEIGHT          |  Depends on VELOCITY
    Higher ‚Üí More PE           |  Faster ‚Üí More KE
                               |
    Can be zero (at ground)    |  Can be zero (at rest)
                               |
    Example: Book on shelf     |  Example: Moving car
    Example: Water at top      |  Example: Flying bullet
                               |

    ENERGY CONVERSION:
    ------------------
    PE can convert to KE and vice versa!

    Example: Dropping a ball
    - At top: Maximum PE, Zero KE (not moving yet)
    - Falling: PE converts to KE
    - At bottom: Zero PE (ground level), Maximum KE (moving fast!)

    Total Energy = PE + KE (Conservation of Energy!)

       Answer: PE = 5 √ó 10 √ó 20 = 1000 J

    3. A person (m = 60 kg) stands on a 2m platform. Find PE. (use g = 10)
       Answer: PE = 60 √ó 10 √ó 2 = 1200 J

    4. An apple (m = 0.2 kg) on a tree at h = 4 m. Find PE. (use g = 10)
       Answer: PE = 0.2 √ó 10 √ó 4 = 8 J

    TIP: To solve these, just change the values of 'mass' and 'height'
         in the solve_question() function above!

    BONUS: What if the apple falls?
    At the top: PE = 8 J, KE = 0 J
    At the bottom: PE = 0 J, KE = 8 J

    ‚úì ALWAYS write the formula first: PE = mgh

    ‚úì Show EVERY step:
      1. Write what is given
      2. Write the formula
      3. Substitute values
      4. Calculate step by step

    ‚úì Check which value of g to use:
      - If question says "use g = 10 m/s¬≤", use 10
      - If it says "use g = 9.81 m/s¬≤", use 9.81
      - If it doesn't specify, ask or use 10 for simplicity

    ‚úì Include UNITS in your answer (Joules or J)

    ‚úì Make sure all units match:
      - Mass in kg (if in grams, divide by 1000)
      - Height in m (if in cm, divide by 100)

    ‚úì Height is measured from a reference point:
      - Usually from the ground (h = 0 at ground level)
      - Sometimes from a table or platform

    ‚úì Check if your answer makes sense:
      - Higher height OR more mass = More PE
      - Answer should be positive (energy can't be negative!)

    COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
    -------------------------
    ‚úó Forgetting to multiply by g (gravity)
    ‚úó Squaring the height (NO! PE is NOT mgh¬≤)
    ‚úó Using wrong value of g
    ‚úó Forgetting units
    ‚úó Not converting cm to m, or grams to kg
    ‚úó Confusing PE with KE

    REMEMBER:
    ---------
    PE = mgh    (m-g-h, think "mega height!")
    KE = ¬Ωmv¬≤   (has ¬Ω and v is squared)
