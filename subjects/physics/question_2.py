    NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION
    ============================

    DEFINITION (Simple Version):
    ---------------------------
    An object will remain at rest or continue moving at constant velocity
    unless acted upon by an external force.


    DEFINITION (Formal Version):
    ---------------------------
    Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight
    line unless it is compelled to change that state by an external force
    acting on it.


    KEY CONCEPTS:
    -------------

    1. TWO STATES OF MOTION:

       a) Object at REST:
          - If nothing pushes or pulls it
          - It will stay at rest FOREVER
          - Example: A book on a table stays there until you move it

       b) Object in MOTION:
          - If moving at constant speed in straight line
          - It will keep moving FOREVER (if no force acts on it)
          - Example: A puck on frictionless ice keeps sliding


    2. WHAT IS "CONSTANT VELOCITY"?
       - Same speed
       - Same direction
       - No speeding up or slowing down
       - No turning or changing direction


    3. INERTIA:
       - This law is also called the "Law of Inertia"
       - Inertia = tendency of an object to resist changes in motion
       - Objects "want" to keep doing what they're already doing
       - More mass = more inertia = harder to change motion


    4. REAL-WORLD UNDERSTANDING:

       Why do things stop moving on Earth?
       - NOT because of Newton's First Law failing!
       - Because of FORCES acting on them:
         * Friction (rubbing against surface)
         * Air resistance (drag)
         * Gravity (pulling down)

       In space (no friction):
       - A spacecraft can drift forever
       - No need for engines once at cruising speed!


    5. EXAMPLES IN EVERYDAY LIFE:

       a) Car Suddenly Stops:
          - You jerk forward
          - Why? Your body wants to keep moving (inertia)
          - Seatbelt provides the force to stop you

       b) Pulling Tablecloth:
          - Quick pull leaves dishes in place
          - Why? Dishes' inertia keeps them at rest

       c) Shaking Thermometer:
          - Mercury moves down
          - Why? Mercury's inertia makes it "want" to keep moving

       d) Standing in Bus:
          - Bus accelerates, you fall backward
          - Why? Your body wants to stay at rest (inertia)


    6. IMPORTANT POINTS FOR EXAM:

       ‚úì Force is needed to CHANGE motion, not maintain it
       ‚úì No force = No change in motion
       ‚úì This law explains INERTIA
       ‚úì Inertia depends on MASS (not weight!)
       ‚úì This law applies in all directions (x, y, z)


    7. COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS (What's WRONG):

       ‚úó "Force is needed to keep things moving"
         ‚Üí NO! Force is needed to CHANGE motion

       ‚úó "Things naturally slow down"
         ‚Üí NO! They slow down because of friction forces

       ‚úó "Heavier objects fall faster"
         ‚Üí NO! (That's a different topic, but still wrong!)


    8. MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION:

       If Œ£F = 0 (sum of forces is zero)
       Then: v = constant (velocity is constant)

       Or: a = 0 (acceleration is zero)

       This means:
       - No net force ‚Üí No acceleration
       - No acceleration ‚Üí Constant velocity (or at rest)

    1. MASS vs INERTIA:
       - Mass is a measure of inertia
       - More mass ‚Üí More inertia ‚Üí Harder to move/stop
       - SI unit: kilogram (kg)

    2. FORCE:
       - A push or pull on an object
       - Required to change motion
       - SI unit: Newton (N)

    3. VELOCITY:
       - Speed in a specific direction
       - Has magnitude (how fast) and direction
       - SI unit: m/s

    4. ACCELERATION:
       - Rate of change of velocity
       - If a = 0, velocity is constant (First Law!)
       - SI unit: m/s¬≤

    5. NET FORCE (Œ£F):
       - Sum of all forces acting on object
       - If Œ£F = 0 ‚Üí Newton's First Law applies
       - If Œ£F ‚â† 0 ‚Üí Newton's Second Law applies (F = ma)

    6. EQUILIBRIUM:
       - When Œ£F = 0 (forces are balanced)
       - Object is in equilibrium
       - Can be at rest OR moving at constant velocity

    STRUCTURE YOUR ANSWER:
    ----------------------

    1. STATE THE LAW:
       "Newton's First Law states that an object will remain at rest
        or continue moving at constant velocity in a straight line
        unless acted upon by an external force."

    2. EXPLAIN INERTIA:
       "This is also known as the Law of Inertia. Inertia is the
        tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion."

    3. GIVE AN EXAMPLE:
       "For example, when a car suddenly brakes, passengers jerk
        forward because their bodies tend to maintain their state
        of motion due to inertia."

    4. MENTION KEY POINT:
       "This law explains why force is needed to CHANGE motion,
        not to maintain it."

    KEYWORDS TO USE:
    ----------------
    ‚úì State of rest
    ‚úì Uniform motion / Constant velocity
    ‚úì External force
    ‚úì Inertia
